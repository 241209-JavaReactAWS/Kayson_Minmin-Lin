    <h1>Sanjae Chin</h1>
    <p>I am Sanjae Chin. I recently graduating with my Computer Science degree this year. When it comes to my favorite language, I’d say it’s C. A bit of an unpopular opinion but I like the control over memory and messing around with pointers. But with all of my time with Java in school and outside of school it has grown to be a close second.
        Outside of programming I like going to the gym, watching anime and a gamer. Recently I tried out Battlerite and have been enjoying it.
